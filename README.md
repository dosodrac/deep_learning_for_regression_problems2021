# Neural Networks with TensorFlow Project (2021)

In this coursework for the Artificial Intelligence module, I had built a succession of Neural Networks (NN) with TensorFlow (TF) and searched for the best configuration of hyperparameters to achieve the best model through the implementation of the universal workflow of machine learning, as presented in the book Deep Learning with Python (Fran√ßois Chollet, 2018). 
I have used the Boston House Pricing dataset (Boston House Prices, Kaggle) to try to predict the median price of homes in a specific Boston suburb from the mid-1970s.

The uploaded files include the Jupyter notebook and a HTML version of that notebook for a easier visualization.
